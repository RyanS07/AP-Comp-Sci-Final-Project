Pressure 1 (kPa),Temperature 1 (K),Pressure 2 (kPa),Temperature 2 (K)
Formula: P1/T1 = P2/T2

Explanation:
Gay-Lussac's Law is a relationship between an ideal gas' pressure and temperature, 
given both its volume and moles are held constant. Pressure 2 and Temperature 2 
refer to the pressure and temperature of the ideal gas at a different point in time. 
 - Ex: 
         10.0kPa/2.00K = P2/1.00K
                            P2 = (10.0kPa/2.00K) * 1.00K
                            P2 = 5.00kPa
