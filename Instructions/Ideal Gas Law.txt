Pressure (kPa),Volume (L),Moles (mol),Temperature (K)
Formula: PV = nRT

Explanation: 
The Ideal Gas Law is a relationship between an ideal gas' pressure (P), volume(V),
moles (n) and temperature (T). R is a constant that applies for all ideal gases.
If 3/4 traits are known, the 4th can be solved for. 
R = 8.314 L*kPa/(mol * K)
 - Ex: 
                (P)(2.00L) = (0.20mol)(R)(298K)
                             P = (0.20mol)(R)(298K) / 2.00L
                             P = 248kPa
