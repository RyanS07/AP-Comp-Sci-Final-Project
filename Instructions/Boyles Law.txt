Pressure 1 (kPa),Volume 1 (L),Pressure 2 (kPa),Volume 2 (L)
Formula: (P1)(V1) = (P2)(V2)

Explanation:
Boyle's Law is a relationship between an ideal gas' pressure and volume, given 
both its moles and temperature are held constant. Pressure 2 and Volume 2 refer to 
the pressure and volume of the ideal gas at a different point in time. 
 - Ex: 
       (10.0kPa)(2.00L) = (P2)(1.00L)
                            P2 = (10.0kPa)(2.00L) / 1.00L
                            P2 = 20.0kPa
