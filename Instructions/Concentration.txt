Concentration 1 (mol/L),Volume 1 (L),Concentration 2 (mol/L),Volume 2 (L)
Formula: (C1)(V1) = (C2)(V2)

Explanation:
Multiplying the concentration (mol/L) and volume (L) of a solution will result in
the moles of that solution. Utilizing this constant, the formula above can be 
derived to solve for the concentration or volume of the same solution at a 
different point in time. For example, adding more water would increase the volume
and lower the concentration. 
 - Ex: 
    (10.0mol/L)(2.00L) = (C2)(1.00L)
                            C2 = (10.0mol/L)(2.00L) / 1.00L
                            C2 = 20.0mol/L
