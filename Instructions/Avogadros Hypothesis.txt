Volume 1 (L),Moles 1 (mol),Volume 2 (L),Moles 2 (mol)
Formula: V1/n1 = V2/n2

Explanation:
Avogadro's Hypothesis is a relationship between an ideal gas' volume and moles, 
given both its pressure and temperature are held constant. Volume 2 and Moles 2 
refer to the volume and moles of the ideal gas at a different point in time. 
 - Ex: 
          10.0L/2.00mol = V2/1.00mol
                            V2 = (10.0L/2.00mol) * 1.00mol
                            V2 = 5.00L
