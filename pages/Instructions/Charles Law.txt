Formula: V1/T1 = V2/T2

Explanation:
Charles' Law is a relationship between an ideal gas' volume and temperature, given 
both its pressure and moles are held constant. Volume 2 and Temperature 2 refer to 
the volume and temperature of the ideal gas at a different point in time. 
 - Ex: 
             10.0L/2.00K = V2/1.00K
                            V2 = (10.0L/2.00K) * 1.00K
                            V2 = 5.00L
