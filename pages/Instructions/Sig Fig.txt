        Sig Fig:
        
        Significant Figures (Sig Fig) is a set of rules that try to retain data precision. 
        The number of sig figs of a number is defined as the number of digits a number 
        has, excluding leading zeros. For example, 2.00 has 3 sig figs, but 0.02 has 1 sig 
        fig. When multiplying and dividing, under the rules of sig fig, the product or 
        quotient is only as precise as the lowest sig fig. For example:
          - 2.00 * 2.0 * 4.00 = 16
          - 16.00 * 0.50 = 8.0
          - 16.00 / 4.0 = 4.0
